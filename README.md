# noideas

I genuinely have no clue what this is supposed to be. Maybe an AI-powered idea generator. Maybe a sentient meme. Honestly, who knows.

> **Minimum requirements:**  
> A GPU with **4 GB VRAM** (NVIDIA preferred, CUDA gang rise up).

## What It Probably Does (???)

- Uses a **tiny uncensored local LLM** (‚â§ 2 GB) to:  
  - Whip up random ideas out of thin air  
  - Expand on vague concepts you throw at it  
  - Spiral your themes into unhinged creative chaos  
- Runs **locally** ‚Äî no sketchy cloud nonsense  
- Possibly cursed (use at your own risk)

## Goals / Vision (if I ever get around to finishing it)

- One-click idea generation UI (or CLI, who knows)  
- Swappable models like Dolphin-Phi, TinyDolphin, or Gemma3 (if you don‚Äôt mind the censored vibes)  
- [Dolphin Phi on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF)  
- Optional theme packs: funny, edgy, startup-pitch, cryptobro-core...  
- Input box where you drop your prompt, theme, or half-baked idea and watch it grow
