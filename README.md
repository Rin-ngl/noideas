# noideas

I genuinely have no idea what this is supposed to be. Maybe an AI-powered idea generator. Maybe a sentient meme. Who knows.

> Minimally requires a GPU with **4 GB VRAM** (NVIDIA preferred, CUDA gang rise up).

## What It Probably Does (??)

- Uses a **tiny uncensored local LLM** (â‰¤ 2 GB) to:
  - Generate random ideas out of thin air
  - Expand on vague concepts from the user
  - Take themes and spiral them into unhinged creative nonsense
- Runs locally, no cloud nonsense
- Possibly cursed

## Goals / Vision (if I ever finish it):
- One-click idea generation UI (or CLI, idk)
- Swappable models (MythoMax-L2, TinyDolphin, whatever fits in VRAM)
- Optional theme packs (funny, edgy, startup-pitch, cryptobro-core...)
- Input box for giving a prompt, theme, or half-baked idea to grow

## Status:
ðŸ’€ **Concept limbo**  
ðŸ“¦ No code exists  
ðŸ§  Model TBD
